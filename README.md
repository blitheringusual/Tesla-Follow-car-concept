### **GitHub Repository Introduction**

#### **Pursuit-Evasion Simulation with Adjustable Agents and Safe Distance**

Welcome to the **Pursuit-Evasion Simulation** repository! This project implements a simplified computational model of collective pursuit-evasion behavior, inspired by natural systems like flocks of birds, schools of fish, and swarms of insects. The simulation demonstrates how multiple agents (hunters) can pursue a single target (prey) while avoiding collisions with each other.

This simulation is based on the mathematical model presented in the paper:

(Replace the link with the actual link to your paper.)

### **Features**

1. **Adjustable Number of Agents**:
   - Use the slider to set the number of hunters (from 1 to 5).
   - Observe how the dynamics change as more agents are added.

2. **Adjustable Safe Distance**:
   - Use the slider to set the safe distance between the prey and hunters.
   - The simulation stops when a hunter gets within the safe distance of the prey.

3. **Direction Visualization**:
   - Each agent is represented by a **triangle**, with the apex pointing in the direction of movement.
   - This makes it easy to visualize where each agent is headed.

4. **Real-Time Simulation**:
   - The simulation runs in real-time, allowing you to observe the pursuit-evasion dynamics as they unfold.

5. **Interactive and Educational**:
   - The simulation is designed to be simple, intuitive, and educational, making it suitable for students, researchers, and enthusiasts.

### **How It Works**

The simulation is based on a **system of differential equations** that govern the movement of the agents. Each agent follows simple rules:
- **Hunters**: Move toward the prey and repel each other to avoid collisions.
- **Prey**: Moves away from the closest hunter.

The simulation is implemented in **Python** using **Matplotlib** for visualization and **sliders** for interactivity.

### **Getting Started**

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   Clone this repository and run the simulation script:
   ```bash
   python pursuit_evasion_triangles.py
   ```

3. **Adjust Parameters**:
   - Use the **Number of Agents** slider to set the number of hunters.
   - Use the **Safe Distance** slider to set the safe distance.

4. **Observe the Simulation**:
   - Watch as the hunters pursue the prey and avoid collisions.
   - The simulation stops when a hunter catches the prey.
